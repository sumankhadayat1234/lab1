-  Delete the topmost row using the **"Delete row"** button.
-  When all rows are deleted, the message changes to:  
  `Message: No more rows to delete`.
-  When a new row is inserted after deletion, the message resets to:  
  `Message:`.


  ## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the `rowcolumn.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the **"Insert row"** and **"Delete row"** buttons to manipulate the table.
3. Watch the **Message** label update automatically.
